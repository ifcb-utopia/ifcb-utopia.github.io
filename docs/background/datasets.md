# Datasets

The ifcbUTOPIA project aims to provide a classifier that is generalizable to data from any region on Earth. To this end, we are training and testing our CNNs on datasets that differ by time and location. Here is a list of our current data sources: 

- The North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) (https://science.larc.nasa.gov/NAAMES/) 
- Export Processes in the Ocean from Remote Sensing (EXPORTS) (https://oceanexports.org/) 
- Fondation Tara Oc√©an's Mission Microbiomes (https://fondationtaraocean.org/en/expedition/mission-microbiomes/)
